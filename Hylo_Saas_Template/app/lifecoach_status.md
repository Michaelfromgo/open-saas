Life Coach Feature Status Report

**Current Issues:**

1. TypeScript errors in chat-operations.ts file
2. Issues with types in multiple files
3. Unable to run application due to compilation errors

**Recommendations:**

1. Temporarily disable the entire Life Coach feature until proper types can be implemented
2. Create a proper TypeScript type definition file for the Life Coach entities
3. Consider a full refactor of the chat-operations.ts file with proper TypeScript typing
4. Work with Wasp framework experts to understand the proper types needed
